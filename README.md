# Data-Structures-and-Algorythms
 My DSA (C++) projects both personal and done at BTH

- Most projects have several test programs as .cpp files, only enable one .cpp file at the time to test different parts of the program if there are multiple.
## The Brief-Algo-Overview file has JUST the algorithms if you dont wish to run entire solutions for each project to see them.
- Contains AllAlgosAAA which has all the algorithms I was learning at the time. Includes:
    - insertionSort
    - selectionSort
    - linearSearch
    - binarySearch
    - linearSearchRecursive
    - binarySearchRec
    - insertionSortWithBinarySearch
    - mergeSort
    - hoaresPartition (for pivoting)
    - heapSort / heapify

- Contains TestExaminationC which is a program that contains most of the difficult algorithms we had to write. that includes:
    - Disjoint sets
    - Graph with Edge and Vertices
    - Prims algorithm
    - Kruskals algorithm
    - MinPriorityQueue
    - Quicksort

- Contains labs i did to show my knowledge that had to be completed in 4-6 hours in the exam room with no internet access depending on the lab.
labs are under hte folders named "Inl√§mningsuppgift-X"
